## Description
<!-- BookStore is a web application that allows users to browse and purchase books from a collection of books. Users can create an account, search for sensor, add them to their cart, and make a purchase. The application also includes a dashboard for the admin user to manage the books, orders, and customers. -->

An IoT water quality monitoring system is a type of Internet of Things (IoT) solution that enables real-time monitoring of the quality of water. It typically consists of sensors, data collection devices, and cloud-based analytics platforms.

The system collects data on various water quality parameters, such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, and chemical composition. The data is transmitted wirelessly to a cloud-based platform, where it can be analyzed and processed.

The system can be installed in various settings, such as drinking water distribution networks, industrial water treatment plants, aquaculture farms, and swimming pools. It can also be used in monitoring the water quality in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water.

## Technologies
The system is built using the following technologies:

- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySql + Sequelize cli
- MQTT

## Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Admin dashboard for managing sensors
<!-- - Admin dashboard for managing books, orders, and customers -->
<!-- - Book search and filtering -->
<!-- - Shopping cart and checkout process -->
